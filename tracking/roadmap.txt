Bigger features on the way
* Module for doing load/saves to an inactive "suspend table";
	this should slot in to the existing callbacks without much breaking changes.

* Make the stuff in fluid_packet_batch and co. work based on partial application;
	they will take the callbacks table to construct the actual function you would normally call.
	This should improve performance as the current mechanism may not optimise so well
	(loads and compares a table each time, which the JIT may have to assume can change each time).
	Also 

* Make the idea of "packets" more generic so they can be something more than volumes of liquid.
	This would involve factoring out the idea of merging packets (currently adding volumes)
	and capacity checks (currently a comparison of volume and capacity in bearer def).
	These would likely then be passed in as an argument or part of callbacks.
